        <p><em>Author</em></p>
        <p>I am an Author and book Publisher. I stumbled onto writing as a way to explain to my children the non-traditional path their mom and I took to have them. I enjoyed writing and soon found myself writing for small business owners,
          webmasters and writing mills. Some of my articles are published on high traffic sites such as <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/can-convert-pension-ira-10228.html">Zacks</a>, <a
            href="https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/leadership-styles-military-25296.html" </href>AzCentral</a> and <a href="https://pocketsense.com/tax-implications-giving-house-child-9524.html">PocketSense</a>. As a college professor for a
          decade, I developed an ability to motivate students through the use of my written words. I quickly grew to love hearing students respond to my messages with news they acheived one or more their goals. I thought, "If I can motivate students,
          why
          can't I motivate others?" Thus, the birth of my <a href="https://sayspire.com">poetry</a> website.</p>

        Her</a>. Sayspire Media, 2019.</li>
    ◦ <em>This book is full of 80 poems about love for the woman in a man's life. It's quite possible the best anniversary gift a wife or girlfriend will ever receive. Upon a Moonlight Kiss makes the job of her knight (boyfriend/husband) in shining
      armor far, far easier, helping even the most practical wife tingle with happiness...without the embarrassment of coming across as mushy, fake, or over the top.</em>
    <li>J. Cintron. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IWZOKVU/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1">What to Expect When You Enroll in An Online Class: Tips & Tricks from an Online Professor</a>. Sayspire Media, 2014.</li>
    ◦ <em>This book is perfect for students who are new to online classes. It's both inspirational and motivational, as I share tips and tricks in how to get good grades. I talk candidly about what works and doesn't work from a student's perspective,
      but also infuse my experiences as an online professor. It's a must read for any student who wants to know the "ins and outs" of an online class.</em>
